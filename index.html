            <h4>The Man Himself:</h4><br>
            <p>Muhammad Ali, born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. on January 17,
                 1942 â€“ June 3, 2016) was an American professional boxer, activist, and 
                 philanthropist. Nicknamed "The Greatest", he is widely regarded as one of 
                 the most significant and celebrated sports figures of the 20th century and 
                 as one of the greatest boxers of all time.<br><br>
                 Ali was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, and began training as an 
                 amateur boxer at age 12. At 18, he won a gold medal in the light heavyweight 
                 division at the 1960 Summer Olympics, and turned professional later that year. 
                 He converted to Islam and became a Muslim after 1961, and eventually took the 
                 name Muhammad Ali.
